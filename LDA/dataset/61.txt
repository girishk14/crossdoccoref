BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have arrested a 22-year-old man suspected of being a member of the Islamic State group.
Federal prosecutors say the German national — identified as Tarik Suleyman S. — was arrested Thursday at Frankfurt airport.
His full name wasn't provided due to German privacy laws.
In their statement Friday, prosecutors said he traveled to Syria in November 2013 and joined IS in January 2014.
The statement says he received firearms training and took part in combat. He is also alleged to have published photos, videos and texts promoting IS and calling for violence against "non-believers" in Germany.
