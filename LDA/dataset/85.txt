Northern Iowa 75, (6) Texas Longhorns 72, final: Paul Jesperson banked in a halfcourt shot at the buzzer, and the 11th-seeded Northern Iowa Panthers upset No. 6 seed Texas 75-72 in a West Region first-round NCAA Tournament game on Friday night in Oklahoma City.

Texas' Isaiah Taylor had just hit a bucket in the lane with 2.7 seconds left to tie the game at 72-72. Northern Iowa opted not to call timeout, instead getting it to Jesperson, who heaved it up before the buzzer from just behind the halfcourt line. The shot bounced off the backboard and right through the net, and the Panthers' celebration was on at Chesapeake Energy Arena.

Northern Iowa advances to take on Texas A&M on Sunday in a second-round game.
