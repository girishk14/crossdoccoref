North Korea defied United Nations resolutions by firing a ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan on Friday, South Korean and U.S. officials said.

This follows North Korea’s nuclear test in January, and its ballistic missile test last month.

State Department spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. is closely monitoring the situation on the Korean Peninsula.

"We call again on North Korea to refrain from actions that further raise tensions in the region and focus instead on taking concrete steps toward fulfilling its international commitments and obligations," Kirby said in a statement.

South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the missile fired from the western area of Sukchun flew about 500 miles before crashing off the North's east coast, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported.

The missile, fired around 5:55 a.m., is believed to be a Rodong missile, the agency reported.

Tough new U.N. sanctions were imposed early this month after China, which has been North Korea's primary benefactor, voted for them. In addition, President Obama ordered new U.S. sanctions on Wednesday.

"The order is not targeted at the people of North Korea, but rather is aimed at the Government of North Korea and its activities that threaten the United States and others," Obama said in a message to Congress.

North Korea has devoted considerable resources to building nuclear weapons — widely estimated at 10 to 16 warheads — and is working on an intercontinental ballistic missile for delivering them.
