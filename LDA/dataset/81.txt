OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) _ Paul Jesperson banked in a halfcourt shot at the buzzer to give 11th seeded Northern Iowa a 75-72 win over No. 6 seed Texas Friday in the first round of the NCAA Tournament's West Region.

Northern Iowa passed the ball in under its basket after Isaiah Taylor tied the game on a layup with 2.7 seconds to play. Jesperson caught the ball, took a few dribbles and heaved.

Wes Washpun scored 17 points, Jeremy Morgan scored 16 and Jesperson added 14 for the Panthers (23-12), who claimed their fifth NCAA Tournament win in school history.

Taylor scored 22 points, Eric Davis Jr. scored 13 and Javan Felix added 12 for the Longhorns (20-13).

Jesperson's shot came in the same building where Golden State's Stephen Curry hit a dramatic game-winner against the Oklahoma City Thunder last month.
