The hactivist group Anonymous is once again targeting Donald Trump in a new video, issuing a worldwide “call to arms” to take down the GOP presidential hopeful.

In a video posted to YouTube, an Anonymous representative — wearing the group’s signature Guy Falkes mask — addresses the camera through a stylized overlay of audio and video distortion. The video urges hackers to knock Trump’s various websites offline, expose personal information, and otherwise conduct “total war” on the candidate.

“Dear Donald Trump, we have been watching you for a long time, and what we see is deeply disturbing,” says the Anonymous member in the new video, which also features video clips of the candidate’s more controversial public statements.

“Your inconsistent and hateful campaign has not only shocked the United States of America, you have shocked the entire planet with your appalling actions and ideals,” says the Anonymous rep. "You say what your current audience wants to hear, but in reality you don’t stand for anything except for your personal greed and power. This is a call to arms.”

This is the second time that Anonymous has targeted Trump in an online campaign. In December, an Anonymous video urged hackers to go after the real estate magnate after he proposed banning Muslims from entering the country.

The video encourages veteran hackers and newcomers alike to participate in Operation Trump — hashtag #OpTrump. The first planned attack is scheduled for April 1, when Anonymous hopes to take down the website for Chicago-based Trump Towers.

But the online offensive may have already begun. Engadget is reporting that Anonymous members have already posted unverified personal information on Trump and his staff, including social security numbers.
