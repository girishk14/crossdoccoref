Its such a dumb decision like wtf are you even fighting for? This reporter asks that a few times and none can give an answer that makes sense.

Also they YPG stands accused of ethnic cleansing of arabs in the areas that it captures from ISIS a great example is Tal Abyad\u00a0which was a majority Arab city in Syria\u00a0that has seen its inhabitants expelled from their homes by the YPG. \u00a0As I am watching this, these people sound so uneducated that I kinda feel sorry for them.\ufeff", "time": "4 days ago", "cid": "z12xy33qlxn1hbaye04chxayvsiyzhcbnkk0k"}

{"text": "Its good to see people fighting with a strong moral compass and for heartfelt reasons, part of me really hates the idea of soldiers getting involved in conflicts just to pay the bills, they know nothing of the culture, history of the people and area they are in. Im not generalising as there are many soldiers who fight for the right reasons and get all my respect but I also know a lot of soldiers who simply are told to point and shoot without thought. I just think the soldier who fights for what they beleive in is always going superior to someone just following orders, but this can also be subjective of course which makes it very dangerous if you are facing someone who has state ideology intertwined with their religious/emotional perspective. We only know too well how strong the Japanese and Germans were and they are a prime example of indoctrination and conditioing from a young age. Same goes for Isis. As for me, if I was to ever fight I guess I would have to be fighting for equality, education,against opression, against racism, homophobia etc ( putting it very briefly as i dont want to write an essay ) half the battle is the fight against our lack of undertstanding and compassion. As wars and conflicts always seem to take root from lack of mindfulness of others and ourselves.

You rarely see the antifa at a rally of Salafists, but if you do they protest the protestors, not the Islamists.\n\nPerhaps it has more to do with the Kurdish approach of autonomy, equality and anarchical localism?!

{"text": "Just another video of sand niggers sand niggin'.\nFuckin' Mohammedan scum. We shouldn't even be in correspondence with these people on any level except for when we need their natural resources, just build a wall with missile systems, let them kill each other and if any of them come within 500m of the wall shoot the fuck out of them. People seem to have a soft spot for Muslims because they have always been on the back foot; But don't think they won't fucking murder you and your family in the name of their religion when they get the chance and know that they can't be held accountable. The Muslim population in Europe is buying it's time and infiltrating the infrastructure of its nations, waiting until these countries are too weak defend themselves - Then you will feel the full force of this religion, and it will be too late. A lot of people will die because the gullible native populations have been programmed to believe this regressive left theory that the world runs on rainbows and fairy dust - The theory that if you are 'nice' to people who subscribe to a highly-expansionist fascist ideology and let them live in yours countries that they will integrate into your society and we will all live happily ever after, regardless of if the Qur'an discourages integration of Muslims into none-Muslim societies. These people do not want your tolerance and kindness - This is a weakness that they are currently capitalising on - They don't want your tolerance, they just want to further the religion and establish the Caliphate.\nIf you are reading this and have lived around Muslims for a long time you know that I speak truth. Hopefully you wake the fuck up in time, though it might be difficult to wake up at first, it was for me. It's hard to break out of the regressive-left sickness when a lot of the people around you are still sheep and will try to label you with buzzwords like 'racist' (a word used out of context when referring to Muslims - Islam is an ideology not a race), or the newly coined buzzword 'Islamaphobe' which is an oxymoron and is absolutely meaningless - A phobia is an irrational fear of something - Believe me when I tell you this, if you are not a Muslim you have every reason to fear Islam, because if you aren't a member of the flock when the clock strikes 12 for the Islamisation of Europe you will be executed or subjugated. This is not fear mongering, I wish it were, I used to a naive leftie in my teens and I was an Islam apologist, then I grew up and formed my own opinion using LOGIC and a knowledge of history and human science - I came to the conclusion that there is currently a silent invasion taking place under our noses, an invasion that is being sanctioned by our own leaders. We might be human beings but we are still animals with animal instincts that prey on the weak - This world is survival of the fittest and the animal that does not defend itself will end up on the endangered species list. There are barbarians at the gates and they will only take a city if somebody opens the gate: That treacherous cunt Angela Merkel has opened the gate of Europe, it was bad enough with the Muslims we already had in our countries that are money grubbing dirty fucks, now it's going to be made even worse with the ones that don't even speak our European languages. \nDo you want to be a lamb for the slaughter? Do you want to see your culture destroyed and replaced with Islam?Do you want to see your countrymen murdered and subjugated?\nIf you answer 'no' to these 3 questions then there is still hope for you and you're not a complete cuck. Wake the fuck up and start sharpening your sword, we are on the precipice of a war of none-Muslims and Muslims reminiscent of Charlemagne and the Battle of Tours.\nThis post isn't very well written because I posted it on my phone but if you can read between the lines I hope whoever reads this takes notice and starts to do their research.

{"text": "This video is hideously loaded with a thinly veiled agenda..Lets go through some of the ironies here: These organizations (PKK/YPG) are self professed Marxist/Leninist groups who go to any extreme (including bombing civilians) to get their views across; yet Western media outlets will go to any length to portray them as heroes and say things like \"This is mostly because Syrian Kurds are brothers-in-arms with the banned Kurdish Workers Party, PKK who are classed as a terrorist organization by the EU. Although the PKK promote gender equality and freedom of religion\" Since when did promoting gender equality exonerate anyone from carrying out terrorist activities or wanting to create a Middle Eastern North Korea? Since when did it become OK to be a Communist revolutionary in the eyes of the West. Not too long ago, Marxist fighters/supporters in places like Guatemala, Angola, Nicaragua, Cuba, Vietnam were fighting against Western backed governments, if not locked in direct combat with Western forces themselves (Bay of Pigs anyone?) How many hundreds of thousands of people died in the past 60 years in places similarly far flung from the West yet whose choice of government style was somehow of grave importance to us? Now what has suddenly changed that Marxist/Leninist supporters are no longer OK to be exterminated like insects in places like Indonesia, with the tacit support of the United States (please refer to the documentary The Act of Killing\" here). Can someone please explain what has changed  all of the sudden? What happened to the Red scare that was thrust down an entire generations throat? The YPGs political agenda is hardly explored at all in this video. I want to hear more about what they have planned for the future of Syria.  If the West has no quarrel with a new autonomous Marxist state in the Middle East then maybe Vice should dig through the archives and start talking about the horrors that took place in the aforementioned countries in the name of \"Freedom and Democracy\" Lets start having that conversation.   Moreover, there is a dangerously close parallel between the statements made by these foreign fighters and the statements made by ISIS recruits when it comes to motive: disenchantment with their comfortable lives in the West, a search for a higher meaning, wanting to be part of a new system etc etc. . Furthermore, I found it alarming and equally disgusting that the German social worker waltzes into a preschool of full of children and the first words that come out of her mouth are \"Are you also revolutionaries\" and then goes on to talk about how these schools promote tolerance between different ethnic groups. One could conclude that these community centers are a more innocuous version of that ISIS propaganda outpost shown earlier in the video. In conclusion, I would like to point out that the enemy of my enemy is not always my friend .

{"text": "+Marek Huska 1. I'd like to get reliable sources and not a made up map (what's the logic behind that anyway? It's on Twitter it must be true (duh..)) You might not know it but we have laws here in Europe which permit religious freedom and the freedom to believe whatever the fuck you want. I don't expect a polish catholic to understand that but there are other religions out there which you have to respect and tolerate. You speak of mass rapes whilst there are only statistics out there that show that a refugee is no more and no less likely to rape women than the average european man. It's funny to see these \"facts\" coming from Brazil, after all the Portuguese committed multiple atrocities in the name of the Lord. My stance on religion is that everyone who believes in this shit shouldn't be able to vote. Every religion is wrong. Ofc Islam isn't the uberpeaceful religion but can't you say that about every other major religion as well? You Poles want to ban abortions because of your intolerant, christian views. You should, also, take a few history and politics lessons. I know you Poles are still butthurt and seek vengeance on Stalin and the UDSSR. So don't you think you're biased? The communists took your religion, your pride and your nationality and completely fucked it over. It's more than natural that you still hate them.
